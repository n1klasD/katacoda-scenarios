# Thank your for your time!

You´ve learned to basics of relational databases. After that, you were introduced to the structure of JSON, and how you 
can craft arbitrary complex JSON documents when nesting JSON objects and lists. The key takeaway is here, that JSON defines
it´s own structure, which makes it very flexible. In contrast to relational database tables, we had to 
define the structure when we created the table. 

We created a table that had a column with datatype JSON using an SQL statement. After inserting multiple entries, we 
looked at the functions `JSON_VALUE`, `JSON_QUERY`, `JSON_INSERT`, `JSON_OBJECT` and `JSON_MERGE` to integrate our 
JSON data into our SQL queries. If you want to learn more about JSON in MariaDB, I have attached a link to the official 
documentation.
