# Using JSON inside of MariaDB

This Katacoda demonstrates how you can use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in relational databases using MariaDB as an
example. Furthermore, the difference between structured and semi structured data is explained and how JSON can be used
in this context to add additional flexibility to our database system.

First you are given a brief introduction to relational databases, MariaDB and JSON. After that, your knowledge about
structured and semi structured data will be applied. We will create a table with a JSON column, insert JSON data and 
finally query and parse the JSON data using SQL.

## Learning Objective

- Understanding JSON
- Create a table with a JSON column in MariaDB
- Insert JSON data into the table
- Read JSON data from the table

## Prerequisite Skills

This course is meant for beginners, who have prior experience with programming, relational databases and 
SQL (Structured Query Languages). Though the basics of relational databases will be refreshed.
